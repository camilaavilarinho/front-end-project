## CurrencyFair project

In this README file, I'll describe the process followed to create the project. To see the project click [here](https://camilaavilarinho.github.io/front-end-project/)

### Process
1. Decide the tools to use: react + redux
2. Think about the react components
    - I Like to think by writing or sketching, because helps me visualize what to do and organize my thoughts
    - [app sketch](./sketches/app.jpg)
3. Think about redux store
    - [redux store sketch](./sketches/store.jpg)
4. Start the development of the biggest components and from them add the smaller ones
    - When creating the components I added the CSS at the same time to make sure that the project was getting the way it should.
5. Add redux to the project When developing the container components (the ones that interact with redux store)
    - Make some changes in the project after trying the first redux store and deciding for a better structure (see redux store sketch - right side)
6. Add the icons - for that I added [react-fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome)
7. _Refactor the code to make responsive and functional in mobile devices. [no time to finish]_
8. _Add tests [no time to do]_

### Problems encountered:
- Font file corrupted - the font file didn’t work so I had to use a similar one (Karla)
- I didn’t have time to finish steps 7 and 8 from the process followed above
